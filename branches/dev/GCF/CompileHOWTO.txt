How To Compile
--------------------

To compile GCF you will need to check out a copy of the code and then 
execute the following command in the directory where you can see include 
and source as child directories

On Linux - 
- cd ~/GCF
- qmake -recursive "GCF_BASE=`pwd`"
- make

On Windows (with Visual Studio 2005) - 
- cd C:\GCF
- qmake -tp vc -recursive "GCF_BASE=%cd%"
- Open VS 2005 and Build All

On Windows (with MinGW)
- cd C:\GCF
- qmake -recursive "GCF_BASE=%cd%" "GCF_DISABLE_ACTIVEX=1"
- mingw32-make

Essentially GCF_BASE should be the complete path of the directory where 
the code is available
