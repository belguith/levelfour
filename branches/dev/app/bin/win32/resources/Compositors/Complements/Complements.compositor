% Color space conversion -- takes the existing scene, and polarizes the
% colors along the color wheel -- colors that are close to the "Guide Color"
% become more like the guide, while colors closer to its complementary color
% in that direction. Parameters allow control of how tightly colors "bunch up" 
% and permits the user to turn the effect so that desaturated colors
% are less affected.

% In the sample image, an orange tone was chosen -- skin tones are reddish and those have
% migrated towards the orange guide, while colors near blue (complement of orange)
% have become bluer.
