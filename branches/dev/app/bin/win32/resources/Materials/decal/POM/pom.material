/*

Parallax occlusion mapping (POM) is an enhancement of the parallax mapping technique. 
Parallax occlusion mapping is used to procedurally create 3D definition in textured 
surfaces, using a displacement map (similar to a topography map) instead of through 
the generation of new geometry.[1]  This allows developers of 3D rendering 
applications to add 3D complexity in textures, which correctly change 
relative to perspective and with self occlusion  in real time 
(Self-shadowing is additionally possible), without sacrificing 
the processor cycles required to create the same effect with 
geometry calculations.[
