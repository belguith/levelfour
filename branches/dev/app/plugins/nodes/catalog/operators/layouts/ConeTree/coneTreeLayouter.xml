  <parameters>
    <parameter name="Description" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="ConeLayoutStrategy positions the nodes of a tree(forest) in 3D space based on 
the cone-tree approach first described by Robertson, Mackinlay and Card in Proc. CHI'91. 
This implementation incorporates refinements to the layout developed by Carriere and Kazman, 
and by Auber.
                 
The input graph must be a forest (i.e. a set of trees, or a single tree); in the case of a forest, 
the input will be converted to a single tree by introducing a new root node, and connecting each 
root in the input forest to the meta-root. The tree is then laid out, after which the meta-root is removed.
                 
The cones are positioned so that children lie in planes parallel to the X-Y plane, with the axis of 
cones parallel to Z, and with Z coordinate increasing with distance of nodes from the root."/>
    <parameters name="ConeTree Parameters">
      <parameter name="Compactness:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="Determine the compactness, the ratio between the average width of a cone in the tree, 
and the height of the cone. The default setting is 0.75 which (empirically) seems reasonable, 
but this will need adapting depending on the data. "/>
      <parameter name="Set Compactness" type="Float"/>
      <parameter name="Compression:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="Determine if layout should be compressed, i.e. the layout puts children closer together, 
possibly allowing sub-trees to overlap. This is useful if the tree is actually the spanning tree of a graph. 
For real trees, non-compressed layout is best, and is the default."/>
      <parameter name="Set Compression" type="Int"/>
      <parameter name="Spacing:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="Set the spacing parameter that affects space between layers of the tree. 
If compression is on, Spacing is the actual distance between layers. If compression is off, 
actual distance also includes a factor of the compactness and maximum cone radius. "/>
      <parameter name="Set Spacing" type="Float"/>
