  <parameters>
    <parameter name="Description" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="This layout strategy takes an input tree and places all the children 
of a node into a containing circle. The placement is such that each child placed 
can be represented with a circle tangent to the containing circle and (usually) 
2 other children. The interior of the circle is left empty so that graph edges 
drawn on top of the tree will not obfuscate the tree. However, when one child 
is much larger than all the others, it may encroach on the center of the 
containing circle; that's OK, because it's large enough not to be 
obscured by edges drawn atop it."/>
    <parameters name="Cosmic Tree Parameters">
      <parameter name="SizeLeafNodesOnly:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="Should node size specifications be obeyed at leaf nodes only 
or (with scaling as required to meet constraints) at every node in the tree? 
This defaults to true, so that leaf nodes are scaled according to the size 
specification provided, and the parent node sizes are calculated 
by the algorithm.  "/>
      <parameter name="SizeLeafNodesOnlyOn" type="Bool"/>
      <parameter name="SetSizeLeafNodesOnly" type="Int"/>
      <parameter name="LayoutDepth:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="How many levels of the tree should be laid out? 
For large trees, you may wish to set the root and maximum depth in order 
to retrieve the layout for the visible portion of the tree. When this 
value is zero or negative, all nodes below and including the LayoutRoot 
will be presented. This defaults to 0. "/>
      <parameter name="SetLayoutDepth" type="Int"/>
      <parameter name="LayoutRoot:" type="TextInfo" defaultValue="What is the top-most tree node to lay out? 
This node will become the largest containing circle in the layout. 
Use this in combination with SetLayoutDepth to retrieve the layout 
of a subtree of interest for rendering. Setting LayoutRoot to a 
negative number signals that the root node of the tree should be 
used as the root node of the layout. This defaults to -1. "/>
