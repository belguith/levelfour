Level Four is an integration of many excellent works of others generously provided as open source:

*VTK* - The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and visualization. VTK supports a wide variety of visualization algorithms including: scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling techniques such as: implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. (http://www.vtk.org/)

*OSG* - The OpenSceneGraph is an open source high performance 3D graphics toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modelling. (http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg)

*VTK Designer* - VTK Designer 2 is visual editor for creating and editing VTK pipelines. It is built using Qt, VTK and Generic Component Framework (GCF). (http://www.vcreatelogic.com/products/vtkd/)

*Generic Component Framework* - A custom component framework built using Qt 4.4.x. Design and develop applications as a collection of decoupled and independent entities. (http://www.vcreatelogic.com/products/gcf/)
